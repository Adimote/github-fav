# GitFav
A system that tells you what a users favourite language is. This project is written in Python

## How it works
This script searches through through all a given users commits, counts the language each line changes of each commit was
 made in, and assigns that commit as the language it was authored in. It's assumed that your favourite language is the
 language you author the most commits with. It won't be 100% correct but it should be pretty close.
